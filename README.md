# A comprehensive guide on Ponyville

>  Embark on an enchanting journey in 'Ponyville', where magic meets mystery! Join Flurry Heart in a gripping adventure to save her world from darkness.

## Project Statistics

Project Statistics are included in the actual code comment section

## Inspiration

Ponyville is an adventure game where the protagonist, Flurry Heart, embarks on a quest to rescue Ponyville from encroaching darkness. The player navigates through three levels, purifying ponies that have already been enveloped by darkness and combating evil spirits.

## How we built it

Our project was developed using the Greenfoot game engine, File IO system and Java. Our team distributed tasks among different classes and collaborated via Github.

The process involved:
Implementing a dynamic grad base game environment with each grid glowing upon proximity to the main character
Exploring various path-finding algorithms, including depth-first search (DFS) and breath-first search (BFS)
Creating a File IO system to lower the complexity of extracting the plotline
Utilizing inheritance and abstract classes to minimize code redundancy

## Challenges we ran into

A significant challenge was developing an efficient path-finding algorithm for the evil spirits to track the main character

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Successfully overcoming the challenge of path-finding algorithms by using a breadth-first search algorithm to optimize the movement of evil spirits toward the main character
Integration of a File IO engine that imports an external file containing all the texts that follow a writing convention to an ArrayList in the game


## What we learned

Through developing Ponyville, we learned about different path-finding algorithms, encapsulation, code efficiency practices, and collaboration skills.
